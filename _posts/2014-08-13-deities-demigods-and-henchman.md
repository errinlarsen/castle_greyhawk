# Deities and Demigods
I have added a [Greyhawk deities]({{ site.baseurl }}/deities/) in the sidebar.

These deities are all that are known to exist in the World of Greyhawk (At
least, for now). In an effort to simplify things, and as a continuation of my
desire to recreate the feel and play of 1st edition AD&D circa the early 1980s,
I've decided to acknowledge only those deities that had been detailed and
introduced by Gary Gygax at that time.

Specifically, in late 1982, Gary began detailing the Greyhawk Pantheon with
articles published to Dragon Magazine. Before that, he rather famously referred
to any "Higher Beings" as simply, "The Gods". Clerics received their spells and
abilities to "The Gods". Small-folk whispered their prayers to "The Gods!" You
get the idea.

It is reported that many of the players in his games would call out to specific
deities from a favorite real-world pantheon, or a particular work of fiction
(anecdotes abound about his players beseaching "Crom" for help). The _Deities and
Demigods_ reference book was published in 1980, and was frequently referenced by
his players.

Dragon Magazine issue #67 changed all that. Beginning in that issue, and
continuing through issue #71, Gary wrote a column called "Deities & Demigods of
Greyhawk". In those articles, he laid out the Pantheon as I've recorded it in
the [Greyhawk deities]({{ site.baseurl }}/deities/) reference page.

These 19 Gods and Goddesses were all that existed then, so that's what we're
starting with now!

**Note:** A previous Dragon Magazine article (issue #64) laid out some
guidelines and advice for _modifying_ the non-human deities in the _Deities and
Demigods_ book for use in Greyhawk. I am selfishly ignoring the spirit and
content of that article! Gods are Gods, and non-humans have to live in the same
world as the humans do. If they wish to worship some or all of these 19 deities,
great! They are free to _name_ those gods anything they want (though, I can't be
held responsible for the Deities' reactions to such misnomers!), but the
underlying _being_ referred to will be one of these 19.

# Henchmen
I've also begun to fill in the details for your various henchman.

Here are a couple of notes:

## Tadhm Flanigan

- (it's pronounced "Tom").
- Mark's PC's henchman
- He is a devoted priest of St. Cuthbert, Acolyte of the Order of the Billets.
- Mark's family, being fine and upstanding citizens, have always employed a
  priest of St. Cuthbert to lead devotionals and services in their own, private
  chapel. Recently, the venerable Patriarch tending the flock of Mark's PC's
  family passed away and Mark's PC's mother requested a replacement from the
  temple in the city.
- Upon discovering that He was leaving home to make it on his own, His
  mother **insisted** that their newly hired acolyte, Tadhm, accompany her
  "widdle baby boy" on his "grand adventure"; for protection, of course.
- Tadhm is wide-eyed and wonder-struck by everything outside the city walls. He
  fears for Mark's PC's soul, but he knows he has time to properly instruct and
  lead Mark's PC toward the glory of St. Cuthbert -- whether he likes it or not!


## Balin Fardthal

- Edwin's PC's henchman
- He is a loyal Veteran/Rogue.
- He is known to leave offerings and devotions to Pholtus.
- Balin is an orphan, rescued from a collapsing mine shaft by Edwin's PC's
  father many years ago. Balin, believing he owed a "life-debt" to Edwin's PC's
  father, swore life-long loyalty to him.
- When Edwin's PC informed his father that he was off to find his own way in the
  world, his father suggested that young Balin should follow along. "Besides,"
  he remarked, "he's been cooped up in this household with nothing significant
  to do for years! The young lad could use the experience!"
- If asked, Balin isn't yet sure how he feels about this turn of events.
