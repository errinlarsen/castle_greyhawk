title: A Few Quick Updates
---

You may notice some changes to the structure and layout of the site. I'm still trying to nail down how this is all going to flow and look, so things may stay in flux for a bit. As I go, though, I'll be careful not to lose any of the _information_ that is here.

I also made some additions to the [Campaign Rules Notes]({{ site.baseurl }}/rules/).

Finally, I have decided the in-game starting date will be **4 Richfest, 575 CY**. If you would like, here is a link to [a good Greyhawk calendar](https://nightshade.obsidianportal.com/wiki_pages/oerth-calendar). A quick summary of Oerth's calendar follows:

## Days and Months of the Year
The sun travels once around Oerth in 364 days. This period is broken into 12 standard months of 28 days each, with four week-long Festivals before each third month.

Oerth (more specifically, the Flan) has a standard week of seven days: _Starday, Sunday, Moonday, Godsday, Waterday, Earthday, and Freeday_. Traditionally, _Godsday_ is a day for worship, while _Freeday_ is a day for rest.

The Festivals are: _Needfest_ in the Winter, _Growfest_ in Spring, _Richfest_ in the Summer, and _Brewfest_ in Autumn. Each festival is 7 days long.

The Dozenmonth of the moon are: _Fireseek_ <span style="font-size: 65%;">(Winter)</span>, _Readying_ <span style="font-size: 65%;">(Spring)</span>, and _Coldeven_ <span style="font-size: 65%;">(Spring)</span>, followed by the _Growfest_ Festival; _Planting_ <span style="font-size: 65%;">(Low Summer)</span>, _Flocktime_ <span style="font-size: 65%;">(Low Summer)</span>, and _Wealsun_ <span style="font-size: 65%;">(Low Summer)</span>, followed by the _Richfest_ Festival <span style="font-size: 65%;">(Midsummer)</span>; _Reaping_ <span style="font-size: 65%;">(High Summer)</span>, _Goodmonth_ <span style="font-size: 65%;">(High Summer)</span>, and _Harvester_ <span style="font-size: 65%;">(High Summer)</span>, followed by the _Brewfest_ Festival; and finally, _Patchwall_ <span style="font-size: 65%;">(Autumn)</span>, _Ready'reat_ <span style="font-size: 65%;">(Autumn)</span>, and _Sunsebb_ <span style="font-size: 65%;">(Winter)</span>, followed by the first week of the New Year; otherwise known as the _Needfest_ Festival.

Oerth has 2 moons: the Great Moon (_Luna_) waxes and wanes in fixed cycles of 28 days each, upon which the months are based, while the Handmaiden (_Celene, the small aquamarine satelite_) which is only full 4 times a year, during the festival weeks.  The two are full together only once a year, on Godsday of Richfest.

Here's a really cool image someone put together that shows all of the above in a rather unique display:
