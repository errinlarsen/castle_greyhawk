# Welcome to Castle Greyhawk!
The call has gone out for heroic, fearless, and kinda foolish adventurers to
out-hack, out-slash, and sometimes even out-think hordes of evil-nastiness!.

## What's happening now at Castle Greyhawk?
The self-proclaimed Herzog Akitrom the Merely Worried is the latest in a long
line of lords of Castle Greyhawk. He has initiated an intense campaign of
advertisement meant to encourage worldly powers usch as the Queen of Celene and
the petty nobles of the Wild Coast to send daring settlers to the lands about
the castle.
