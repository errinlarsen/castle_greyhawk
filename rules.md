## Misc. Notes
- Members of the thief class are not restricted to wearing **only** leather
  armor. However, a thief's chance of performing one of the special functions of
  the class may be lessened if he or she is otherwise attired.

    See _Unearthed Arcana_, pg. 22 for further details.
    Also, see the _Unearthed Arcana_ [errata](https://www.acaeum.com/library/errata_ua.html)

- The "Class performance classification" system detailed in the _Dungeon
  Master's Guide_, pg. 86, will be followed when XP rewards are given out. As
  such, weapon and armor restrictions are not (usually) a hard limit, but
  instead directly influence the amount of time and money level advancement
  requires.

    There are several exceptions, notably: Magic-user's can NOT cast spells while
    wearing armor (exception: multi-classed Fighter/XYZ PCs), Thieves are
    penalized (see above) according to the _Unearthed Arcana_, pg. 22, and
    Cleric's using bladed weapons will (possibly) be punished by their
    respective Deities (as determined by the DM).

- The Bard class is an acceptable PC profession. The rules for becoming a Bard
  will be strictly observed.

    ie. The fastest possible progression to full Bard-dom is as follows:

        1st level Fighter + 35,001 XP => 5th level Fighter, and then ...
        1st level Thief + 20,001 XP = 5th level Thief, and then ...
        1st level Bard -- still under druidical tutelage.

    Notes:

    - This exact progression is the same whether the PC is a Human, or a
      Half-elf (contrary to the idea that Half-elves can only "multi-class").
    - When the prospective Bard ceases her Fighter profession to
      become a Thief, the penalties and restrictions detailed in the section
      _"The Character With Two Classes"_, in the _Player's Handbook_, pg. 33
      will be followed.
    - As such, The character will retain her HPs, but all other functions of the
      character are at 1st level of experience, for that is her ability in the
      newly espoused class (ie. 1st level Thief).
    - The same would happen again upon cessation of the Thief profession -- The
      HPs gained from Fighter, and then (if any), Thief, would be retained, but
      all other abilities revert to that of a 1st level Bard.

- I intend to utilize the modifications suggested in the _Dungeon Master's Guide_,
  pg. 82, in the section titled _"Progression On The Combat Tables"_. In effect,
  the first '20' in any _Combat Matrix_ can be obtained with any roll of the d20
  and applied bonuses. The 2nd, and subsequent, '20's in any _Combat Matrix_
  represents a _NATURAL_ '20' (the die must be showing a '20'), regardless of
  any to-hit bonuses.


## Fighting style proficiencies
**Fighters, rangers, and paladins my spend proficiency points on a _fighting
style_. Thieves, assassins, and monks also variously have options for fighting
styles.** _ONLY_ fighters may specialize in a fighting style at 1st level.
_ONLY_ one fighting style is intended to be used by any character at any time.

  Obviously (?), if a character changes the standard weapons they use, especially
  if it's a change in weapon specializations, they should be able to then adopt a
  fighting style to fit that weapon.

### Two-weapon fighting style
Any character may actually use two weapons at once. Using two weapons without
specializing in the style has limited benefits. When the character wins
initiative they can choose to make an additional attack with the secondary
weapon, but this carries penalties of -2/-4 to hit with their primary/secondary
weapon, respectively.

Possible primary weapons are: battle axe, bo stick, jo stick, hand axe, club,
dagger, horseman's flail, hammer, footman's mace, horseman's mace, footman's
pick, horseman's pick, scimitar, broadsword, longsword, shortword.

Possible secondary weapons are: jo stick, hand axe, dagger, hammer, horseman's
mace, horseman's pick, shortsword.

Fighters, rangers, paladins, thieves, assassins, and monks may spend a
proficiency point to specialize in this style, reducing the to-hit penalties and
gaining other benefits. Note that any weapon used with this fighting style must
ALSO be allowed by the characters class and the character must be proficient
with any weapon he intends to use with this style.

Specializing in this style grants a bonus to AC of +1, not unlike having a
buckler shield. However, short of special, additional, magical construction, a
magic weaopn will **not** add to that AC bonus. It's a flat +1 AC bonus versus
**one attack** (see _Player's Handbook_, pg. 36). It won't be improved by
skills/abilities concerned with shields.

A bonus attack with the secondary weapon is still allowed **ONLY** when the user
wins initiative for the round, but the specialist has only a -1 to-hit penalty
for all attacks (with both the primary and secondary weapon).

### Two-handed weapon fighting style
Fighters, rangers, paladins, assassins, and monks may spend a proficiency point
to specialize in this style (thieves do not have a two-handed weapon allowed by
their class). This grants the ability to sacrifice 1 point to-hit for 1 point of
damage (assuming she then does still successfully hit). The amount exchanged can
be equal to all the character's to-hit bonuses or 4 points, whichever is greater.

  Even if the character has no bonus to-hit, she can still give herself a to-hit
  penalty and add it to damage if she successfully hits.

### Weapon and Shield specialization
I have detailed notes/thoughts about weapon specialization. I have, after too
much research, concluded that the system as written is ... not the best. I have
a (in my opinion) well thought out and designed replacement. However, as both
PCs are currently multi-classed (see [Multi-classing](#Multi-classing), below), I will not detail
that system here.

  I will endeavor to document these new specialization rules in the near future.


## Combat notes
- Whenever you wield just one weapon, **ANY** opponent who closes with you, or
  you close with them (not just when someone charges!), means that initiative
  between those two combatants defaults to the _longer_ weapon. Want to get in
  the first strike every time? Use a spear instead of a longsword. However, this
  cuts both ways. Be wary of a line of orcs with spears because they DON'T have
  to charge to reliably get first strike.

- Projectile missle weapons now have an additional range category: _extreme_. It
  doesn't extend the range of weapons, it increases the penalty for making
  really long range shots up to -8! The distances for the other range categories
  have been adjusted as well so don't expect to be shooting an arrow at
  something 400 feet away and hitting it with any reliability.

- When dealing with magical projectile weapons and magical projectiles, only the
  highest plus applies. A +3 bow and a +3 arrow doesn't get you +6!

- **All missile weapons, magical and mundane, are, by _default_, assumed to NOT
  be "strength" weapons** (ie. weapons which are built to actually take
  advantage of a user's greater-than-normal strength, such as a bow with a much
  higher pull). Such weaopns are rare enough as mundane weapons to never
  actually be found for sale either - not even in the biggest cities. Such
  weapons must be commissioned and made from scratch (at increased cost, of
  course!) and this may also take a LONG time. Projectiles must be similarly
  beefed up for a strength weapon to be of use. Ergo, although strength bonuses
  CAN apply to projectile weapons, they rarely do.

    Strength bonuses do apply to thrown weaopns -- again, if the weapons are built
    to enable it (more likely with thrown weapons than, say, bows or crossbows,
    due to the much shorter time it takes to make one).


## Player character races
- All _Player's Handbook_ races are available, as described in that source.
- Grey elves, as described in the _Unearthed Arcana_ are available, with the
  following modification: Grey elves receive +1 Int/-1 Str; however, they do
  NOT receive the High Elves' +1 Dex/-1 Con
- All the Elves described in the _Unearthed Arcana_ are available as ancestors
  for Half-elf characters, but no bonuses or penalties _based_ on that ancestry
  will apply, other than those detailed in the _Player's Handbook_, which apply
  to **all** Half-elves.


## Starting Hit Points
As per _Unearthed Arcana_, pg. 74: "If the initial **ROLL** of the die (or
dice, for rangers and monks) is lower than the number given below, then the
character is granted this number of hit points to begin his or her
adventuring career" (_emphasis, mine_).

I'm interpreting that sentence to mean the following numbers are minimum
**_rolls_** for a starting character. You should still adjust these minimums
according to the character's Constitution-based _Hit Point Adjustment_.

    Cleric     5    Magic-user     3
      Druid    5      Illusionist  3
    Fighter    6    Thief          4
      Paladin  6      Assassin     4
      Ranger   9    Monk           5


## Multi-classing

### Armor/weapon restrictions
Although able to operate freely with the benefits of armor, weapons, and magical
items available to the classes the character is operating in, any thieving is
restricted to the armor and weaponry usable by the Thief class.

  see the _Unearthed Arcana_, pg. 22, and its [errata](https://www.acaeum.com/library/errata_ua.html) for the effects of armor on Thief functions.

### Weapon proficiencies
The multi-class PC will recieve the "better" of their multiple classes' number of
initial weapon proficiencies, and will continue to gain proficiencies as per
that class's rate.

### Weapon specialization
The benefit of weapon specialization, described in _Unearthed Arcana_, pg. 18,
is available to all **single-classed** (but not multi-classed) fighters and
rangers.

See the _Unearthed Arcana_ [errata](https://www.acaeum.com/library/errata_ua.html)

### Experience points
All earned experience is always divided equally among the classes of the
character, even though the character is no longer able to gain levels in one or
more of the classes.

### Hit points
Hit points are determined with the following formula:

    (HD for leveling class + Con bonus)/Number of classes

To determine _Starting Hit Points_, roll **each** class's HD\*\*, add the
Con bonus\*\*\*, and then average the results by the number of classes.

  - \*\* respect Class-based _Starting Hit Points_ minimum Hit Die rolls (see [Starting Hit points])
  - \*\*\* respect Class-based maximum Hit Point Adjustement bonuses (see _Player's Handbook_, _Constitution Table_, pg. 12)

For Example:

- A first level Fighter/Thief, with a Constitution of 17, rolls a d10 as her
  Fighter Hit Die, and a d6 for her Thief Hit Die. Her actual die rolls are:

        Fighter[d10]:   7; Thief[d6]:   2

- First, he would apply the _Starting Hit Points_ minimums, arriving at:

        Fighter:        7; Thief:       4

- Then she will add her Con bonus to both, respecting the _Constitution
  Table_'s maximum Con bonus to _Hit Point Adjustment_ (a Fighter gets a +3
  with a Constitution of 17, but a Thief is limited to a +2). Therefore, we
  arrive at the following:

        Fighter (7+3): 10; Thief (4+2): 6

- Finally, average the results by the number of classes (2 in this example):

        ([Fighter] 10 +     [Thief] 6) / 2 = 8

**Note:** when multi-classed characters are no longer able to progress in any
given class, they no longer gain the hit dice for that class.

### Age
Though it is easily overlooked in the _Dungeon Master's Guide_, pg. 12, "For
multi-classed characters use the column which develops the highest age and use
the greatest possible addition to the base age; ie. do NOT generate the age
variable by random die roll, but assign the maximum."

This, in effect, makes Edwin's character (Grey elf Fighter/Magic-user: 150 +
5d6) 180 years old, while Mark's character will be (Half-elf Fighter/Thief: 22 +
3d8) 46 years old.
