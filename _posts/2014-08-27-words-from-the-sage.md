I found this gem in the Preface of the original AD&D _Dungeon Master's Guide_,

> As this book is the exclusive precinct of the DM, you must view any non-DM player possessing it as something less than worthy of honorable death. <span style="font-size: 65%;">(Gygax, 8)</span>

lol!

<!-- more -->

Here's another one from the same book. This snippet is regarding a Thief and his _Hide in Shadows_ ability:

> As is plainly stated in Players Handbook, this is NEVER possible under direct (or even indirect) observation. If the thief insists on trying, allow the attempt and throw dice, but donâ€™t bother to read them, as the fool is as obvious as a coal pile in a ballroom. <span style="font-size: 65%;">(Gygax, 19)</span>

I have been coming to understand that Gygax was viciously unforgiving to those players who tried his patience!

Again -- lol!
