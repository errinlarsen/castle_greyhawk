<span style="margin-left: 10%; font-size: 65%; background-color: #C3FDB8;">As this document is updated, I will mark the most recent changes with this highlight color.</span>  
<span style="margin-left: 10%; font-size: 65%; background-color: #C3FDB8;">The order of the sections and sub-sections of this document have been re-arranged to more closely follow the order of rules as presented in the _Player's Handbook_ and the _Dungeon Master's Guide_.</span>  
<span style="margin-left: 10%; font-size: 65%; background-color: #C3FDB8;">The _Miscellaneous_ section has been moved to the end.</span>  

## Character Creation
### Player Character Races
- All _Player's Handbook_ races are available, as described in that source.
- Grey elves, as described in the _Unearthed Arcana_, are available for PCs with the following modification: receive +1 Int/-1 Str; however, do NOT receive the High Elves' +1 Dex/-1 Con.
- All the Elves described in the _Unearthed Arcana_ are available as ancestors for Half-elf characters, but no bonuses or penalties _based_ on that ancestry will apply, other than those detailed in the _Player's Handbook_, which apply to **all** Half-elves.

### <span style="background-color: #C3FDB8;">Starting Languages</span>
<span style="background-color: #C3FDB8;">The languages a starting PC can speak is determined according to the following steps:</span>

  1. <span style="background-color: #C3FDB8;">Every PC speaks "common" and their Alignment tongue.</span>
  2. <span style="background-color: #C3FDB8;">PCs speak their race-specific starting languages as listed in the _Players Handbook_ (see pgs. xy-yz)</span>
    - <span style="background-color: #C3FDB8;">Dwarves: _dwarven, gnome, goblin, kobold, and orcish_</span>
    - <span style="background-color: #C3FDB8;">Elves: _elvish, gnome, halfling, goblin, hobgoblin, and orcish_</span>
    - <span style="background-color: #C3FDB8;">Gnomes: _dwarvish_ [sic] _, gnome, halfling, goblin, kobold_</span>
        - <span style="background-color: #C3FDB8;">In addition, Gnomes can communicate with any burrowing mammal(!?) (eg. moles, badgers, ground squirrels, etc)</span>
    - <span style="background-color: #C3FDB8;">Half-elves: _elvish, gnome, halfling, goblin, hobgoblin, orcish, and gnoll_
    - <span style="background-color: #C3FDB8;">Halflings: _dwarven, elven, gnome, goblin, halfling, and orcish_</span>
    - <span style="background-color: #C3FDB8;">Half-orcs: _orcish_</span>
  3. <span style="background-color: #C3FDB8;">Some races have special starting language considerations:</span>
    - <span style="background-color: #C3FDB8;">_Each additional language chosen in the following way will_ **reduce** _the PC's maximum possible additional languages received from high Intelligence!_</span>
    - <span style="background-color: #C3FDB8;">_Any additional languages chosen must be approved by the Dungeon Master._</span>
    - <span style="background-color: #C3FDB8;">Elven PCs **optionally** speak one additional language at start for each point of Intelligence above 15; ie. an Elven PC with an 18 Int. optionally speaks up to an additional 3 languages.</span>
    - <span style="background-color: #C3FDB8;">Half-elven PCs **optionally** speak one additional language at start for each point of Intelligence above 16; ie. a Half-elven PC with an 18 Int. optionally speaks up to an additional 2 languages.</span>
    - <span style="background-color: #C3FDB8;">Halfling PCs **optionally** speak one additional language at start for each point of Intelligence above 16; ie. a Halfling PC with an 18 Int. optionally speaks up to an additional 2 languages.</span>

### Multi-classing
#### Armor/weapon restrictions
Although able to operate freely with the benefits of armor, weapons, and magical items available to the classes the character is operating in, any thieving is restricted to the armor and weaponry usable by the Thief class. (see the _Unearthed Arcana_, pg. 22, and its [errata](https://www.acaeum.com/library/errata_ua.html), for the effects of armor on Thief functions.)

#### Weapon proficiencies
The multi-class PC will recieve the "better" of their multiple classes' number of initial weapon proficiencies, and will continue to gain proficiencies as per that class's rate.

#### Experience points
All earned experience is always divided equally among the classes of the character, even though the character is no longer able to gain levels in one or more of the classes.

#### Hit points
Hit points are determined with the following formula:

    (HD for leveling class + Con bonus)/Number of classes

To determine _Starting Hit Points_, roll **each** class's HD <sup>1</sup>, add the Con bonus <sup>2</sup>, and then average the results by the number of classes.  
<span style="margin-left: 10%; font-size: 65%;">
  <sup>1</sup> respect Class-based <em>Starting Hit Points</em> minimum Hit Die rolls (see above)</span>  
<span style="margin-left: 10%; font-size: 65%;">
  <sup>2</sup> respect Class-based maximum Hit Point Adjustement bonuses (see <em>Player's Handbook</em>, <em>Constitution Table</em>, pg. 12)</span>

For Example: A first level Fighter/Thief, with a Constitution of 17, rolls a d10 as her Fighter Hit Die, and a d6 for her Thief Hit Die. Her actual die rolls are: Fighter[d10]: 7; Thief[d6]: 2. First, she would apply the _Starting Hit Points_ minimums, arriving at: Fighter: 7; Thief: 4. Then she will add her Con bonus to both, respecting the _Constitution Table_'s maximum Con bonus to _Hit Point Adjustment_ (a Fighter gets a +3 with a Constitution of 17, but a Thief is limited to a +2). Therefore, we arrive at the following: Fighter[7+3]: 10; Thief [4+2]: 6. Finally, average the results by the number of classes (2 in this example): (Fighter[10] + Thief[6] = 16) / 2 = 8.

**Note:** when multi-classed characters are no longer able to progress in any given class, they no longer gain the hit dice for that class, **<span style="background-color: #C3FDB8;">but they still count that class in the divisor when gaining hit points for their other classes!</span>**

### Starting Hit Points
As per _Unearthed Arcana_, pg. 74: "If the initial **ROLL** of the die (or dice, for rangers and monks) is lower than the number given below, then the character is granted this number of hit points to begin his or her adventuring career" (_emphasis, mine_).

I'm interpreting that sentence to mean the following numbers are minimum **_rolls_** for a starting character. You should still adjust these minimums according to the character's Constitution-based _Hit Point Adjustment_.

    Cleric     5    Magic-user     3
      Druid    5      Illusionist  3
    Fighter    6    Thief          4
      Paladin  6      Assassin     4
      Ranger   9    Monk           5

### Age
Though it is easily overlooked in the _Dungeon Master's Guide_, pg. 12, "For multi-classed characters use the column which develops the highest age and use the greatest possible addition to the base age; ie. do NOT generate the age variable by random die roll, but assign the maximum."

This, in effect, makes a Grey elf Fighter/Magic-user 180 (150 + 5d6) years old, while a Half-elf Fighter/Thief 46 (22 + 3d8) years old.

## Miscellaneous
- Members of the thief class are not restricted to wearing **only** leather armor. However, a thief's chance of performing one of the special functions of the class may be lessened if he or she is otherwise attired.

    See _Unearthed Arcana_, pg. 22 for further details.  
    Also, see the _Unearthed Arcana_ [errata](https://www.acaeum.com/library/errata_ua.html)

- The "Class performance classification" system detailed in the _Dungeon Master's Guide_, pg. 86, will be followed when XP rewards are given out. As such, weapon and armor restrictions are not (usually) a hard limit, but instead directly influence the amount of time and money level advancement requires.  

    There are several exceptions:  
  
    - Magic-user's can NOT cast spells while wearing armor! _Unless_, that is, the Magic-user in question is a multi-classed Demi-human or a Human with two or more classes; see the _Elves_ racial entry in the _Player's Handbook_, pg. 17)
    - Thieves are penalized (see above) according to the _Unearthed Arcana_, pg. 22
    - Cleric's using bladed weapons will (possibly) be punished by their respective Deities (as determined by the DM).

- I intend to utilize the modifications suggested in the _Dungeon Master's Guide_, pg. 82, in the section titled _"Progression On The Combat Tables"_. In effect, the first '20' in any _Combat Matrix_ can be obtained with any roll of the d20 and applied bonuses. The 2nd, and subsequent, '20's in any _Combat Matrix_ represents a _NATURAL_ '20' (the die must be showing a '20'), regardless of any to-hit bonuses.
