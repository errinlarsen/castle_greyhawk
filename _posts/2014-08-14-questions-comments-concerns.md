title: Questions, Comments, Concerns?
---

I frequently have more than 5 different and disparate concerns ongoing at once.
I believe the vast majority of people are the same way. Work, home, family,
hobbies, entertainment - all can be significant distractions. I can't always
"shift gears" to answer a question, or deal with a concern regarding my D&D
game at the same moment that you want the question answered, or the issue
resolved.

Because of these time/attention constraints, I believe we need a clear and
useful way to [asynchronously][] resolve these concerns as they appear.

For that reason, I tested the GitHub Issues tracker, with the intent that it get
used for this purpose. I used the tracker itself to document the process, and
show examples along the way. [Read that issue by clicking this link][1].

The short version goes like this: Click the new "New Question/Issue" link in the
sidebar, fill out the form you are taken to, wait for an email notifying you
that the issue was updated with a comment, answer, resolution, etc.
