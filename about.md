title: About Castle Greyhawk

### The back of the module
Deep beneath the keep of Castle Greyhawk, a really nasty device is creating all
these gross, mutated, and unpleasant monsters that are running wild throughout
the castle and the 12-level dungeon beneath the castle. The call has gone out
for heroic, fearless, and kinda foolish adventurers to out-hack, out-slash, and
sometimes even outh-think hordes of doughmen, headless mice, manic bee queens,
really bad dead things, burgermen, crazed chefs, and movie moguls. If they
survive these and much odder obstacles, the characters wtill have to find the
nasty monster creator and put it out of business.

_Castle Greyhawk_ contains 13 different levels for adventuring and exploration.
Each level is a separate adventure written by a different author and eachhas
its own unique brand of insane and baffling weirdness. Some levels involve
solving puzzles and some require good old hacking and slashing. The adventures
together form a grand quest to free Castle Greyhawk from the evil, rotten
hordes that are plaguing it. The common theme of this dungeon is that no joke
is so old, no pun is so bad, and no schtick is so obvious that it can't be used
to confuse and trip up PCs!
